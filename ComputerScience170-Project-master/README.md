The final project is in the folder "Final Products"

We have two versions of the project to test out. There is one with the Gui and one without. Both work. The one with the Gui creates a splash screen and then starts the same way the one without without it. 

Sarz++ is new planet that the user lands land on. It is full of surprises and scary creatures. To survive, the player must find the vital resources. 

The game is a text adventure game and the user is able to choose which item they want to start out with. Either one will give you some sort of advantage in the game.

From there, the user navigates around the world to pick up items and face enemies. 

The user can battle enemies or run away. If the user runs away, they may or may not take damage. 

In order to win the user need to pick up at least 3 plants and at least 1 one water to win. They also need to survive attacks by enemies.
