Guide Written by Anirrudh Krishnan on April 26th, 2016 
GitHub Desktop Version: 3.0.17.0
Minimum OS required is Windows 7

Step 1: Navigate to https://desktop.github.com/ and download GitHub for Desktop. 
		This is a free program made by the people at GitHub for GitHub. Keep
		in mind that this will NOT work for BitBucket, which is unfortuantley 
		what we use in class. 
Step 2: Install this program. You will be installing both the Desktop App and
		will automatically install the Git pacakage for windows, which is
		needed to commit. Open GitHub. Upon opening, you will be asked to Log-in 
		to your GitHub. Proceed via initial setup. 
Step 3: Once you are here, there will be nothing open and you will be staring 
		at a blank screen. There will be a "+" button in the left hand corner. 
		Click on it, and go to the "Clone" tab. Once in the Clone tab, you will 
		be looking at all your Repositories AND all the ones that you have been 
		invited to collaborate. Click on the Repository you would like to clone
		to your machine, and find the folder that you would like to clone into. 
		I just cloned into the default folder, C:/User/Documents/GitHub
Step 4: If you want to commit, what you need to do is copy the folders/files 
		that you want to commit from wherever they are located. Then, go to the
		GitHub folder into the project folder and go ahead and paste it. Now, 
		give the desktop application a few seconds to recognize that there are 
		new folders/files. They will show up. 
Step 5: Write a brief description and such about the files you will be uploading,
		then hit "Commit to Master". Let it commit.
Step 6: Finally, in the upper right hand corner there will be a "Sync" button. 
		Click it. Let it sync. 
Step 7: MAKE SURE IT UPLOADED!! Open GitHub in a Web Browser and navigate to the 
		project folder, maksing sure your work uploaded!
